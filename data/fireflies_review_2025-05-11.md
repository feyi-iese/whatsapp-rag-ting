# Fireflies Review — Meeting Notes

## Meta Details
- **Host:** Feyi Agbaje  
- **Date:** Sunday, May&nbsp;11 (02:25 PM – 02:38 PM)  
- **Language:** English (Global)  
- **Attendees:**  
  - Feyi Agbaje (host)  
  - Hadiza — hadizawonu@gmail.com (invited)  
- **Topic:** Economic outlook, investment strategies & market‑risk discussion driven by changing Fed dynamics  

---

## Overview
- **Economic Outlook & Investment Strategies**  
  Fed likely to cut rates aggressively by late Q3/Q4; 5‑ to 7‑year bonds attractive; defensive stocks/bonds recommended over the next 3–4 months; U.S. real yield (~4.4 %) makes bonds appealing.  
- **Changing Fed/Market Relationship**  
  Traditional “Fed cuts ⇒ yields collapse ⇒ credit spreads tighten ⇒ equities rally” loop may be broken; non‑QE environment reduces global demand for Treasuries; long‑end rates (7, 10, 30 yr) still dictate equity cost.  
- **Investor Complacency & Risks**  
  Persistent rebounds have bred complacency; “great moderation” tail‑winds (globalisation, low inflation) are fading; limited fiscal/monetary room means potential downturn before modest growth resumes.

## Detailed Notes

### 1. Economic Outlook & Investment Strategies (00:00 – 01:38)
- Aggressive Fed cuts expected to start late Q3 (Sep) or Q4 due to growth drag from tariffs.  
- **5‑ to 7‑year bonds** (“belly of the curve”) viewed as most attractive.  
- Shift to **defensive stocks/bonds** for the next **3–4 months**.  
- CBO projects U.S. debt will dampen growth rather than spark runaway yields.  
- U.S. **penny real yield ≈ 4.4 %** → bonds favourable.

### 2. Changing Fed–Market Dynamics (01:40 – 03:19)
- Classic playbook (Fed cuts → 10‑yr yield collapses → credit tightens → equities up) may no longer apply.  
- In a **non‑QE** world, foreign appetite for Treasuries is lower; long‑end rates may stay stubbornly high.  
- Equity markets must adjust: **overnight rate ≠ cost of equity**.

### 3. Investor Complacency & Market Risks (05:16 – 06:38)
- Markets extrapolate past “great moderation” (low inflation + strong growth) incorrectly.  
- Globalisation tail‑wind weakening; fiscal policy already loose; monetary policy less potent.  
- Ample Treasury supply could keep long yields elevated; downside risk before return to modest growth.

### 4. Long‑Term Investment Recommendations (08:36 – 10:36)

| Horizon | Allocation Shift | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Near‑term (3 mo)** | 60/40 → **40/60** (equities/bonds) | Defensive posture amid expected volatility |
| **Long‑term (core)** | 60/40 balanced | Once stability returns |
| **Hedge** | Add **3–4 % gold** | Dollar downside hedge |
| **Return Outlook** | Modestly positive (lower than last 15 yrs) | U.S. equities still likely to outperform via IP‑driven advantages |
